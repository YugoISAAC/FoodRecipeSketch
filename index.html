                <h5>METHODS</h5>
                    <ol>
                        <h3>Step 1</h3>
                        Parboil the beef (or any meat of your choice) with the spices listed above.
                        <h3>Step 2</h3>
                        Add water so that more than half of the entire beef is submerged, then add 2 seasoning cubes, teaspoon of beef seasoning spice, 1 cup of sliced onions, one tea spoon of salt and a teaspoon each of curry/thyme.
                        <h3>Step 3</h3>
                        Peel of the outer back of the ginger/garlic, pound or grind.
                        <h3>Step 4</h3>
                        Parboil the rice the normal way, boil about 7 cups of water in a pot, add the four cups of rice and allow to cook for 10 minutes.
                        <h3>Step 5</h3>
                        Then pour out and wash thoroughly with clean water then set aside in a bowl or plastic sieve as you will see in my jollof rice videos below.
                        <h3>Step 6</h3>
                        Pick out the parboiled tasty beef and deep fry, this wouldn’t take more than 10 minutes.
                        <h3>Step 7</h3>
                        Cooked beef on the left side and the stock on the right side. This beef stock is a very important in Nigerian cooking.
                        <h3>Step 8</h3>
                        Once you are done with frying the beef, reduce the oil to 250ml (1 cup) just add the remaining one cup of sliced onions, stir for 1-2 minutes and add the ground tomatoes. I like to commence cooking jollof rice with the same oil I used in frying the beef, Using a fresh oil is just the same as cooking without the beef stock (meat water) which actually hold over 70 percent of the ingredient that is used in making most Nigerian foods, the end result is a tasteless meal.
                        <h3>Step 9</h3>
                        Frying the tomatoes would take about 30 minutes. Fry until when you lift a portion with your frying spoon you will notice the oil continues to boil in the spoon. You also notice the tomatoes turning dark.
                        <h3>Step 10</h3>
                        Once the tomato is well fried, remove half and set aside. add the meat water to the remaining fried tomato in the pot, the ground ginger/garlic, a teaspoon each of curry and thyme, two teaspoons of salt then add 3 cups of water, 750ml (Please use the recommended cups), add another seasoning cube. Stir and taste, it should taste overly spiced. Don’t worry, once the rice is added the taste would balance.
                        <h3>Step 11</h3>
                        Then add the rice and cover to cook.
                        <h3>Step 12</h3>
                        Add the fried tomatoes you initially removed, (I do this so my rice doesn’t start burning before it is properly cooked.
                        <h3>Step 13</h3>
                        Then just cook till the rice is soft for consumption, Remember that you can add water occasionally.
                        <h3>Step 14</h3>
                        Voila!!! Turn and serve with the fried meat.
                        <h3>Step 15</h3>
                        This is just how to make jollof rice, you can serve with the fried meat, salad and maybe a bottle of your favorite drink
